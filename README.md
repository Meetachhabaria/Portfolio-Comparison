### **Should I invest in Ray Dalio’s all weather portfolio?**

#### My current portfolio is 100% equity index funds. However, I am considering Ray Dalio’s all weather portfolio. Compare the following portfolios to help me decide:

  1.	My current portfolio of 100% equity index funds, which you may approximate with ticker SPY (S&P 500 ETF)
    
  2.	A balanced portfolio of 60% equity and 40% bonds, which you may build from tickers SPY and TLT (long-term U.S. government bond ETF)
    
  3.	Ray Dalio’s all weather portfolio, which you may build from tickers SPY, TLT, IEF (intermediate-term U.S. government bond ETF), and GLD (gold ETF)
